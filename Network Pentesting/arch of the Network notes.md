group the network pentest pages in group named `network pentest `
- Every heading1 is a Page
- Every heading2 is just a heading in the Page of Heading1 
- except the AD it will be a Page include subpages:
	- **Attacking Active Directory: Initial Attack Vectors**
	- **Attacking Active Directory: Post-Compromise Enumeration**
	- **Attacking Active Directory: Post-Compromise Attacks**
	- Every Heading in them will be considered as a normal heading in the page and section
	

I will export the notes from notion and edit the structure(images-folders-files-etc..) with obsidian and then push them in `github` repo and then SYNC it with `gitbook`
