- We have compromised a user account as we get FrankCastle user and it’s hash ( with Responder) and crack it and get on Machines using SMB relay **without getting the hash** and we able to **dump SAM file and collect hashes in that way after we have compromise the next it to enumerate the network using compromises .**
- **PowerView tool (Power shell tool) :** allows us to look at the network and to enumerate basically the domain controller , domain policy and etc.
- **Bloodhound tool :** visualize what is going in the network and where we can find sensitive user that might be log in and where we can find **shortest path to get the domain admin.**

# PowerView

- **Download the tool :**
    
    [PowerView-3.0 tips and tricks](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/184f9822b195c52dd50c379ed3117993)
    
- **Useful Resource for powerview :**
    
    [Active Directory Enumeration With PowerView](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Ow_LKanMo)
    
- Running powerview from directly any windows machine we have , for attacker situation if he has access to a shell then we ‘ll use that shell and **we ‘re going to load powershell.**
- **Bypass execution policy using powershell - Ready for executing scripts :**
    
    ![198.jpg](198.jpg)
    
- **Up powerview to enumerating the domain :**
    
    ![199.jpg](199.jpg)
    
- **Get information about the domain ( where are domain controllers and much more) :**
    
    ![200.jpg](200.jpg)
    
- **Get information about domain controllers ( Name , ip and much more) :**
    
    ![201.jpg](201.jpg)
    
- **Get the domain policy :**
    
    ![202.jpg](202.jpg)
    
- **Get detailed information about system access of the policy** ( Note the Minimum password length and how to use this information or password complexity all these information open ways for hacker) :
    
    ![203.jpg](203.jpg)
    
- Get net users ( **Get data about users in domains , you can find interesting description with passwords sometimes** ) :
    
    ![204.jpg](204.jpg)
    
    ![205.jpg](205.jpg)
    
    - Filtering outputs to do it more easily.
- **Get the property the user might have :**
    
    ![206.jpg](206.jpg)
    
    ![207.jpg](207.jpg)
    
    - Get a specific property of item we want ( like password last list).
    
    ![208.jpg](208.jpg)
    
    - logoncount property which can identify **honeybot accounts.**
    
    ![209.jpg](209.jpg)
    
    - Get how many bad password to see if any of **these accounts is under attack ( many trials on it ).**
- **List all computers on the domain :**
    
    ![210.jpg](210.jpg)
    
    ![211.jpg](211.jpg)
    
    - for more information and as before you select specific property like OperatingSysetm ( Greb feature).
- **Get information about groups :**
    
    ![212.jpg](212.jpg)
    
    ![213.jpg](213.jpg)
    
    ![214.jpg](214.jpg)
    
                                            **Get all admin groups using wild card.**
    
    ![215.jpg](215.jpg)
    
    - Get information about specific member in the group.
- **Get all SMB sharing in the network :**
    
    ![217.jpg](217.jpg)
    
- **Get all group policy :**
    
    ![218.jpg](218.jpg)

# **Bloodhound**

- **Download Invoke-Bloodhound :**
    
    [powershell/SharpHound.ps1 at master · puckiestyle/powershell](https://github.com/puckiestyle/powershell/blob/master/SharpHound.ps1)
    
- Download a data of AD ( when we are on a machine or network ) and visualize data on the graph.
- Run a tool called neo4j and we should to set it up - change default credentials- Go to local host to change default password for more security :
    
    ![220.jpg](220.jpg)
    
- **Invoke-Bloodhound :** power shell tool using for grabbing data - Downloading this file on Windows 10 machines ( which you get access from previous stage).
    - **To be able to use scripts :**
        
        ![221.jpg](221.jpg)
        
    - **Running sharphound :**
        
        ![22.jpg](22.jpg)
        
    - **Running the script to get data collection from specific domain - Get this file copied to kali machine  :**
        
        ![222.jpg](222.jpg)
        
- Now we have our data transferred from our windows machine ( we get in the last phase) to Bloodhound - Processing all json file  :
    
    ![223.jpg](223.jpg)
    
    - Here we find out the shortest path to Domain admins . Here , we should have session on the punisher machine **which has it local admin and this will lead us to DOMAIN ADMINS @MARVEL.LOCAL ( our domain admin) + Have session now unlike spiderman machine. [ Token impersenation ] .**
- We always do enumeration after each step and ask what information is here for us after we got access we enumerate and still in this cycle as every step you do , you have more information to know about.
- After compromising one account what can we do with that account?
