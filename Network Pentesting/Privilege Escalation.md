```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

then we need know which machine we are on and what it can do so we can check itâ€™s name by **hostname** command in both linux and Windows

```powershell
tasklist /svc
```

*it shows u the procesess that are running on the same account not the higher priv*

```bash
ipconfig /all
```
