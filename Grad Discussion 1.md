# Cyber Security process and he importance of penetration testing

# What is the Recon Phase, why it's Important?
Automation need
efficiency and scalability and saving cost and time in penetration testing
# the challenges of the Recon
- complicated & long process
- Hard to handle by individuals
- the engagement of the pentesting program is limited time so it's hard to waste all ur time to just expanding ur attack surface

# Project Overview:
multi-platform security kit designed for automating the reconnaissance process
Main Goal: 
- to be a complete security kit contains all it takes to make the pentesting process much easier and structured well orgainzed 
- Security for everyone 
- automate the process saving cost and Time

**Subdomain Enumeration**
	Highlight the significance of subdomain enumeration in identifying potential attack surfaces.
		- Subdomain enumeration expands the attack surface by identifying additional entry points that may be overlooked in a traditional security assessment
		- identify forgotten or unused subdomains that may still be active and pose security risks.

	- getting all the urls and help in mapping the app
	- understand how websites and applications have evolved over time
	- dentification of Legacy Code and Vulnerabilities:
	- identify deprecated APIs, which might still be accessible and pose security risks if not properly decommissioned.

**Filtering for JS Files 
	potential security implications of overlooked JS files 
		- Analyzing JS files helps identify client-side vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or insecure data handling on the client side
		- Understanding Application Logic:
		- Identification of Sensitive Information and hardcoded secrets
		- Identifying unused or unclaimed subdomains helps prevent subdomain takeovers, where attackers could potentially take control of abandoned subdomains
		- Threat Modeling: Understanding the full scope of subdomains

**Params**
	 - potential security implications of overlooked parameters
		 - Identification of Attack Surfaces
		 - identifying security misconfigurations related to user input validation and handling
		 - Identifying and analyzing parameters aids in crafting targeted payloads to test for injection vulnerabilities (SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting).
		 - input points for fuzzing and exploitation attempts.
		 - Parameter analysis is crucial for understanding how web application firewalls (WAF) may be configured and bypass them.
